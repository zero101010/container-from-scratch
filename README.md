# container-from-scratch

- This application was a example to explain how works the container. To do This I understand the concept of that running in bash script and isolating the process using namespace, creating CHROOT and the CGROUP. If do you want to chack how this work only with bash script fell free to check `definition.md` and `container.bash`.
- I love golang, and I thought that would be a good chance to use my learned about container and use golang.

```
sudo go run main.go run /bin/sh
```
